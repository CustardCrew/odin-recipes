    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simplified version of the Indian classic combines chicken, tomato sauce, and a slew of 
        aromatic spices all in one pot to make a flavorful dinner that’s just as good as the version you’ll get at restaurants — only way easier to make.  
        Serve it over rice with a bit of cilantro to balance the heat and dinner is done.</p>
